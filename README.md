This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router v6's catch-all route. When navigating to a non-existent route, the catch-all route, intended to display a '404 Not Found' page, fails to render. This example shows the incorrect behavior and the solution to resolve it.  The problem is caused by a missing key prop in the Route component. The key prop is essential for React to correctly identify and update the components when routes change.  The solution adds the key prop to the Route component.  This ensures that React correctly mounts and unmounts the components, resulting in correct rendering of the catch-all route.
